    <h1>About Coffee Junkie</h1>
    <p><h4>India's Long And Deep Coffee Culture</h4>
        India is a department store for coffee, growing both arabica and robusta, under filtered shade, at altitudes of about 1,500 feet (457 m) to about 4,500 feet (1370 m). The shade comprises evergreen leguminous trees, with nearly fifty different species being found on the plantations.<br>
        <br>
        
        The total area under coffee cultivation in India was 404,645 hectares. Some 99 percent of the farmers are smallholders with less than 10 hectares of land. The productivity of arabica was approximately 513 pound/acre (575 kg/ha), and robusta was 942 pound/acre (1,056 kg/ha).<br>
        <br>
        The traditional coffee growing areas are the three southern states of Karnataka (Coorg, Chikmagalur, Bababudan, and Biligiri districts), Kerala (Wayanad, Travancore, Nelliampathy, and KannanDevan districts), and Tamilnadu (Nilgiris, Shevaroys, Pulneys, and Anamalais).<br>
        <br>
        <h4>coffee cup iconCoffee And Us….. Inseperable</h4>
        South Indian coffee, also known as Kaapi (South Indian phonetic rendering of "coffee'), Mysore filter coffee or Madras kaapi or simply filter coffee, is typically a coffee drink made by mixing frothed and boiled milk with the decoction obtained by brewing finely ground coffee powder in a traditional Indian filter.<br>
        <br>
        The beverage is especially popular in the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. Outside India, a coffee drink prepared using a filter may be known as Filter Coffee or as Drip Coffee as the water passes through the grounds solely by gravity and not under pressure or in longer-term contact.
