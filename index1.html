      <p style="width:50%">  A beautiful blend of Pea berry and flat beans are carefully  roasted in medium to dark for an ideal
         balance that is best suited for milk based coffees such as Café Latte and Cappuccino.House Blend 
         coffee is unique to every coffee shop, every roaster, and every drinker. That is what makes them 
         so unique and so special. The blending and serving process is built entirely on the preference of 
         the roaster and/or distributor. For example, Starbucks describes their House Blend as <em>
         “the very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. The one blend that set the course for 
         the way our master blenders and roasters work even today. A true reflection of us and delicious cup 
         of coffee, period.” </em>

    <h2>French Roast Coffee</h2>

</p>   
<p style="width:50%">  Simply put, “French roast” describes the color of the coffee beans after they have been roasted. These beans are on the darker end of the scale, and are usually the color of dark chocolate. It does not mean the coffee was grown or roasted in France (although yes, that is where the roasting style originated in the 1800s). The name is believed to reflect the tastes and traditions of coffee roasters in Europe in the 19th century, where dark roasted coffee was all the rage. <strong>Italian roast</strong>, or espresso roast, was nearly as dark as French, and Vienna roast – a staple of the Viennese cafes and pastry shops known for their great coffee – was slightly lighter than Italian roast. But the French proudly took the honors as the <b>darkest roast of all.</b>

         <h2>Columbian Roast Coffee</h2>
         <br>
         <img src="./images/Columbian Roast.jpg" alt="Columbian Roast Coffee"><br>
         <p style="width:50%">You could say that Colombian coffee is regular coffee. It isn't a type of coffee bean, roast profile, or brew method. Colombian coffee is just coffee that has been grown within the borders of Colombia. You'll find Colombian coffee often used in more premium packs of coffee at places like the supermarket. Colombian coffee is coffee that is grown in Colombia. Colombian coffee tends to demand a higher price because it is mostly made up of the superior arabica variety. Colombian coffees can have heavy notes of chocolate and nuts, or lighter fruit and floral notes, depending on which department it’s grown.
